## What is a field?

A field is simply an attribute defined in your database. Examples of fields:
`first name`, `gender`, `status`, etc.

## Customizing a field

Forest allows you to customize how a field appears in your admin interface. You
can rename it, choosing the right widget to display (e.g. `text area`, `image
viewer`, `Google map`), adding a description or even setting the read/write
access.

field to start configuring it.

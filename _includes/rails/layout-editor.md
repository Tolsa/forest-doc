# Layout Editor

Customizing your admin is essential to get all your teammates onboarded easily.
No code required, you can directly configure the interface directly using the
Forest Layout Editor.

After enabling the Layout Editor, orange UI components appear in your admin to
start the customization.

## Navigation bar

In the navigation bar, drag'n'drop the collection to reorder them. Enabling or
disabling the orange checkbox of a collection allows you to configure its
accessibility for the users that are part of the current Forest team you're
currently logged in.

## Collection settings

You've certainly noticed there's an orange "cog" icon beside each collection in
the <a href="#navigation-bar">navigation bar</a>. This icon gives you access to
all your collection settings:

### General

This is where you can rename a collection, set a beautiful icon, choose the
default sorting, set a collection as read-only, and more.

### Fields

This is where you can setup the global settings of your fields: rename a field,
set a custom description, set a field as read-only, choose the right widget to
display (e.g. text area, image viewer, Google map, etc.), and more.
